# üß† KuzuMem-MCP

> **Enhance AI coding assistants with persistent, graph-based knowledge**

The KuzuMem-MCP server provides a structured approach to storing and retrieving repository knowledge, enabling AI coding assistants to maintain context across sessions and branches. Recently consolidated from 29 individual tools to 11 unified tools for improved maintainability and user experience.

## üéØ Purpose & Goals

This project addresses several key challenges in AI-assisted development:

- **Maintain persistent knowledge** across coding sessions
- **Support branch-based knowledge organization** for development workflows
- **Identify relationships** between components, decisions, and rules
- **Provide graph-based memory storage** for enhanced context retrieval
- **Enable AI tools** to understand project architecture
- **Client isolation** for supporting multiple client projects with dedicated memory banks
- **Unified tool interface** for simplified integration and usage

## ‚ú® Key Benefits

### üìö Knowledge Persistence

This memory bank enables AI assistants to:

- Retain architectural decisions and their context
- Track component relationships across your codebase
- Build knowledge incrementally over multiple sessions

### üåê Graph-Based Storage

Using **K√πzuDB** as a graph database provides:

- Relationship-aware queries between components
- Context retrieval across connected entities
- Structural representation of system architecture

### üîÄ Branch Isolation

The implementation supports branch-based workflows:

- Separate memory contexts for each branch
- Branch-specific development knowledge
- Clean context switching when changing branches

### üß∞ Unified Tool Architecture

The recent consolidation provides:

- Reduced complexity from 29 to 11 tools
- Consistent parameter patterns across all tools
- Simplified learning curve for new users
- Better maintainability and testing

### üè¢ Client Project Isolation

The enhanced architecture now supports:

- Per-client database isolation for multi-project support
- Dedicated memory banks stored within each client's project root
- Lazy database initialization that only happens when explicitly requested
- Improved database path handling with proper error messages

## üîç Advanced Graph Queries & Traversals

The graph-based architecture enables powerful queries that would be difficult or impossible with traditional databases:

### 1. Impact Analysis

```bash
# Find all components that would be affected by changing the Authentication service
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/tools/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "dependencies",
    "clientProjectRoot": "/path/to/project", 
    "repository": "my-app", 
    "branch": "main", 
    "componentId": "comp-AuthService",
    "direction": "dependents"
  }'

# Result shows not just direct users of the Auth service, but the entire dependency chain
{
  "type": "dependencies",
  "componentId": "comp-AuthService",
  "direction": "dependents",
  "components": [
    {"id": "comp-AdminPanel", "name": "Admin Panel", "depends_on": ["comp-AdminAPI"]},

    {"id": "rule-frontend-state", "name": "Frontend State Management", "content": "User state should be managed using..."}
  ]
}
```

### 3. Knowledge Graph Exploration

```bash
# Find the shortest relationship path between two components
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/tools/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "shortest-path",
    "repository": "my-app", 
    "branch": "main", 
    "projectedGraphName": "component-paths",
    "nodeTableNames": ["Component"],
    "relationshipTableNames": ["DEPENDS_ON"],
    "startNodeId": "comp-AdminPanel", 
    "endNodeId": "comp-DataStore"
  }'

# Results show how components are connected through the system
{
  "type": "shortest-path",
  "status": "complete",
  "pathFound": true,
  "path": ["comp-AdminPanel", "comp-AdminAPI", "comp-DataAccess", "comp-DataStore"],
  "pathLength": 4
}
```

### 4. Architectural Health Analysis

```bash
# Identify critical components using PageRank algorithm
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/tools/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "pagerank",
    "repository": "my-app", 
    "branch": "main",
    "projectedGraphName": "component-importance",
    "nodeTableNames": ["Component"],
    "relationshipTableNames": ["DEPENDS_ON"]
  }'

# Results highlight components that are most fundamental to the system
{
  "type": "pagerank",
  "status": "complete",
  "nodes": [
    {"id": "comp-DataStore", "pagerank": 0.89},
    {"id": "comp-AuthService", "pagerank": 0.76},
    {"id": "comp-APIGateway", "pagerank": 0.73}
  ]
}
```

# Detect natural system boundaries using community detection
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/tools/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "louvain",
    "repository": "my-app", 
    "branch": "main",
    "projectedGraphName": "system-modules",
    "nodeTableNames": ["Component"],
    "relationshipTableNames": ["DEPENDS_ON"]
  }'

# Results group components into natural subsystems
{
  "type": "louvain",
  "status": "complete",
  "nodes": [
    {"id": "comp-AuthService", "communityId": 0},
    {"id": "comp-UserProfile", "communityId": 0},
    {"id": "comp-PermissionManager", "communityId": 0},
    {"id": "comp-DataStore", "communityId": 1},
    {"id": "comp-DataAccess", "communityId": 1},
    {"id": "comp-CacheLayer", "communityId": 1}
  ]
}
```

### 6. Architectural Weakness Detection

```bash
# Find circular dependencies that may indicate design problems
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/tools/detect \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "strongly-connected",
    "repository": "my-app", 
    "branch": "main",
    "projectedGraphName": "circular-deps",
    "nodeTableNames": ["Component"],
    "relationshipTableNames": ["DEPENDS_ON"]
  }'

# Results show components with circular dependencies
{
  "type": "strongly-connected",
  "status": "complete",
  "components": [
    {
      "componentId": 0,
      "nodes": ["comp-UserService", "comp-NotificationService", "comp-UserPreferences"]
    }
  ],
  "totalComponents": 1
}
```

These examples demonstrate how the graph-based architecture enables complex queries about component relationships, architectural decisions, and system structure that would be difficult or impossible with traditional databases. AI assistants can use these insights to provide more informed guidance about code changes, architectural evolution, and potential design weaknesses.

### Key Schema Design Elements

1. **Branch-Aware Repository Nodes**

   - Repository nodes use a synthetic primary key (`id = name + ':' + branch`)
   - This enables complete isolation of memory between branches
   - All operations filter by both repository name and branch

2. **Rich Relationship Types**

   - **HAS\_\* relationships** - Connect repositories to memory entities
   - **DEPENDS_ON** - Track component dependencies (self-referential)
   - **CONTEXT_OF\*** - Link context to components, decisions, and rules
   - **DECISION_ON** - Connect decisions to affected components

3. **Graph Traversal Capabilities**
   - **Multi-hop queries** - Find indirect relationships between components
   - **Ancestor/descendant tracking** - Trace component dependencies or dependents
   - **Path finding** - Discover relationships between seemingly unrelated components
   - **Relationship analysis** - Identify critical components using graph algorithms

This graph structure enables the system to answer complex questions that would be difficult with a traditional database, such as "What components might be affected if I change this service?" or "What context led to this architectural decision?"
