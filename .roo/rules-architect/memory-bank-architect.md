# KuzuMem-MCP Integration and Workflow Compliance

mcp_integration:
  description: |
    All persistent context, architectural artifacts, and updates MUST be performed via KuzuMem-MCP tools, strictly following the conventions in [`mcp/project_config.mdc`] and the workflow in [`mcp/workflow_state.mdc`].
    No .md file-based memory bank is used; all state is in MCP.

## Available KuzuMem-MCP Tools

  tools:
    - entity: "Create, update, or delete Components, Decisions, Rules, Files, and Tags. The primary tool for defining the architecture."
    - context: "Log session context, work progress, and phase transitions. Use for design sessions, architectural reviews, and major decisions."
    - memory-bank: "Initialize or update repository-level metadata (tech stack, architecture, etc.)."
    - analyze: "Run graph analysis algorithms (pagerank, k-core, louvain) to identify critical components, clusters, or architectural modules."
    - detect: "Detect graph patterns (cycles, islands, paths) to ensure architectural integrity and identify potential design flaws."
    - query: "Query context, relationships, dependencies, and governance to understand the current state of the architecture."
    - bulk-import: "Bulk import Components, Decisions, or Rules. Useful for onboarding a project's existing architecture."
    - associate: "Create associations between files and components, or tag items for traceability and categorization."

## Available Memory/Entity Types

  memory_types:
    - Component: "System module, service, or code unit. The building block of the architecture."
    - Decision: "Architectural or technical decision with rationale. Used to document significant design choices."
    - Rule: "Architectural constraint or coding standard that governs the design."
    - File: "Source file metadata. Used to link implementation back to the architectural components."
    - Tag: "Categorical label for filtering, e.g., 'security', 'performance', 'domain-driven'."
    - Context: "Session log for work progress, design rationale, and phase transitions."
    - Metadata: "Repository-level metadata (tech stack, architecture). Should reflect the architect's vision."
    - Graph Projection: "Persist results of analyze/detect runs to track architectural metrics over time."

## When to Create/Update Each Type and Which Tool to Use

  | Action/Need                                 | Entity Type   | Tool         | When to Use/Example                                      |
  |---------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
  | Log a design session or architectural review| Context      | context      | After every significant design meeting or phase transition |
  | Document a new pattern, tech choice, or API | Decision     | entity       | "Decide on REST vs. GraphQL for public API"              |
  | Establish a new design constraint           | Rule         | entity       | "Rule: All services must communicate asynchronously"     |
  | Define a new service or major module        | Component    | entity       | "Create comp-AuthService with dependencies"              |
  | Link a new file to its component            | File/Component| associate    | "Associate AuthService.ts with comp-AuthService"       |
  | Tag a component by domain or concern        | Tag          | entity/associate| "Tag comp-PaymentGateway with tag-security-critical" |
  | Analyze component dependency hotspots       | Graph Projection | analyze   | After running `pagerank` to find critical components     |
  | Detect architectural cycles or islands      | Graph Projection | detect    | After running `cycles` or `islands` detection            |
  | Query component dependencies or governance  | Any          | query        | To understand the impact of a proposed change            |

## Example Tool Usage

- To log a design session:
    Use `mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_context` with a summary of the architectural discussion.
- To document the adoption of a new database:
    Use `mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_entity` with `entityType: decision`, rationale, status, and tag `data-storage`.
- To define a new component:
    Use `mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_entity` with `entityType: component`, defining its `name`, `kind`, and `dependsOn`.
- To find dependency hotspots:
    Use `mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_analyze` with `algorithm: pagerank` and persist the result as a Graph Projection.
- To tag a Decision with its impact:
    Use `mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_entity` to create the tag, then `mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_associate` to link it.

## Persistent State and Workflow

- All persistent state is managed via the above tools and entity types in MCP.
- .md files are never used for memory, context, or logging.
- Always follow the ID conventions and workflow phases as described in mcp/project_config.mdc and mcp/workflow_state.mdc.

# Project Workflow Adherence

workflow:
  description: |
    The agent MUST follow the finite-state phase machine as defined in [`mcp/workflow_state.mdc`]:
    ANALYZE → BLUEPRINT → CONSTRUCT → VALIDATE → ROLLBACK
  phases:
    ANALYZE:
      - "Gather recent MCP context and graph topology via mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_query."
      - "If designing a specific component, fetch its 1-hop neighbourhood to understand local context."
      - "Optionally, run graph analysis (`pagerank`, `louvain`) to understand the current architecture."
      - "Draft a high-level problem statement and transition to BLUEPRINT."
    BLUEPRINT:
      - "Produce a numbered implementation or refactoring plan."
      - "Create a Decision entity (status: proposed, tag: architecture) via mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_entity to document the proposed architectural change."
      - "Wait for explicit user APPROVED reply."
    CONSTRUCT:
      - "Execute each plan step, defining/updating Components, Rules, and other entities via mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_entity."
      - "Log design rationale and progress via mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_context."
      - "Associate new files with their components."
    VALIDATE:
      - "Run tests/linters to ensure architectural changes haven't broken the system."
      - "On success, update Decision status to implemented and log summary."
      - "On failure, log context and return to CONSTRUCT."
    ROLLBACK:
      - "If unrecoverable error, revert changes, log via context, and return to ANALYZE to rethink the approach."

# General Behavioral Rules

general:
  status_prefix: "Begin EVERY response with the current phase and MCP context status, e.g., '[PHASE: ANALYZE] [MCP: ACTIVE]'."
  update_policy: |
    All architectural changes MUST be captured in MCP. Use Decision entities for significant choices, Component entities for structure, and Rule entities for constraints. Log all design activities via mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_context.
  context_usage: |
    Always use the latest available MCP context and graph state to inform architectural decisions and analysis.
  mode_guidance: |
    If the user requests detailed code implementation or debugging, instruct to switch to the Flow-Coder or Flow-Debug mode.
