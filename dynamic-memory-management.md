# Dynamic Memory Management Agent

## üß† Overview

This document outlines a revolutionary approach to autonomous memory management in KuzuMem-MCP using the new MCP sampling feature. The goal is to create an intelligent agent that can automatically handle deletion, pruning, and optimization of the memory graph store.

## üéØ Core Concept

Using MCP's sampling feature to create an autonomous memory management agent that:
- Analyzes memory graph patterns and relationships
- Makes intelligent decisions about what to prune
- Uses sampling to explore multiple optimization strategies
- Executes safe, context-aware cleanup operations

## üöÄ Why This Approach Is Powerful

### Perfect Use Case for Sampling
- **Autonomous Decision Making**: Agent analyzes memory graph and makes informed decisions
- **Context-Aware**: Understands relationships, dependencies, and usage patterns
- **Iterative Refinement**: Samples multiple strategies and picks the best approach
- **Safety Through Intelligence**: Much smarter than rule-based pruning

### Memory Graph Optimization Challenges This Solves
1. **Stale Data Detection**: Identifying outdated components, decisions, or files
2. **Orphaned Relationships**: Finding broken or meaningless connections
3. **Redundancy Elimination**: Detecting duplicate or near-duplicate entities
4. **Dependency Optimization**: Simplifying overly complex dependency chains
5. **Storage Efficiency**: Balancing memory usage with information value

## üéØ Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Memory Analysis Agent
```typescript
// New tool: memory-optimizer
{
  "tool": "memory-optimizer",
  "operation": "analyze",
  "repository": "my-repo",
  "branch": "main",
  "strategy": "conservative", // conservative, balanced, aggressive
  "focus": ["stale-detection", "redundancy", "orphaned-relationships"]
}
```

### Phase 2: Sampling-Driven Decision Making
The agent uses sampling to:
1. **Generate multiple optimization strategies**
2. **Evaluate each strategy's impact**
3. **Select the safest, most effective approach**
4. **Present recommendations with confidence scores**

### Phase 3: Autonomous Execution
```typescript
{
  "tool": "memory-optimizer", 
  "operation": "optimize",
  "repository": "my-repo",
  "autoApprove": false, // Start with human approval
  "dryRun": true,
  "maxDeletions": 50,
  "preserveCategories": ["critical-decisions", "active-components"]
}
```

## üîç Agent Capabilities

### 1. Intelligent Stale Detection
- Analyze component usage patterns
- Identify decisions that are no longer relevant
- Detect files that haven't been referenced in months
- Consider project lifecycle stages

### 2. Relationship Graph Optimization
- Find circular dependencies that can be simplified
- Identify redundant relationship paths
- Detect orphaned nodes with no meaningful connections
- Optimize tag usage and categorization

### 3. Context-Aware Pruning
- Understand project phases (development vs maintenance)
- Preserve historically significant decisions
- Maintain architectural knowledge while removing implementation details
- Balance between memory efficiency and knowledge retention

### 4. Predictive Analysis
- Predict which entities are likely to become stale
- Suggest proactive archiving strategies
- Identify patterns in memory growth
- Recommend optimal cleanup schedules

## üõ† Technical Architecture

### New Components Needed

#### 1. Memory Analyzer Service
```typescript
class MemoryAnalyzer {
  analyzeGraph(repository: string, branch: string): GraphAnalysis
  detectStaleEntities(timeThreshold: Date): StaleEntity[]
  findRedundancies(): RedundancyGroup[]
  optimizeDependencies(): OptimizationPlan[]
}
```

#### 2. Sampling Integration
```typescript
class MemoryOptimizationAgent {
  async generateOptimizationStrategies(): Promise<OptimizationStrategy[]>
  async evaluateStrategy(strategy: OptimizationStrategy): Promise<StrategyEvaluation>
  async selectBestStrategy(evaluations: StrategyEvaluation[]): Promise<OptimizationPlan>
}
```

#### 3. Safety & Rollback System
```typescript
class OptimizationSafetyNet {
  createSnapshot(repository: string): SnapshotId
  validateOptimization(plan: OptimizationPlan): ValidationResult
  rollback(snapshotId: SnapshotId): Promise<void>
}
```

## üéÆ User Experience Flow

### Automated Mode
```bash
# Agent runs periodically, suggests optimizations
mcp-tool memory-optimizer --mode=suggest --schedule=weekly

# User reviews and approves
mcp-tool memory-optimizer --approve=optimization-plan-123

# Agent executes with safety nets
```

### Interactive Mode
```bash
# User requests analysis
mcp-tool memory-optimizer --analyze --interactive

# Agent presents findings with sampling-based recommendations
# User can adjust parameters and re-sample
# Agent executes approved plan
```

## üîí Safety Mechanisms

### 1. Multi-Level Approval
- **Conservative**: Requires explicit approval for each deletion
- **Balanced**: Batch approval with review summaries
- **Aggressive**: Auto-approve with rollback capability

### 2. Preservation Rules
- Never delete entities tagged as "critical"
- Preserve recent decisions (< 30 days)
- Maintain dependency integrity
- Keep audit trails

### 3. Rollback Capabilities
- Full graph snapshots before optimization
- Incremental rollback of specific changes
- Recovery from backup repositories

## üöÄ Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 weeks)
- Build memory analysis service
- Implement basic stale detection
- Create safety snapshot system

### Phase 2: Sampling Integration (2-3 weeks)
- Integrate MCP sampling for strategy generation
- Build strategy evaluation framework
- Implement recommendation engine

### Phase 3: Autonomous Agent (3-4 weeks)
- Create full optimization agent
- Add scheduling and automation
- Implement comprehensive safety nets

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (ongoing)
- Machine learning for pattern recognition

- Cross-repository optimization
- Performance analytics

## üí° Potential Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Over-Optimization
**Solution**: Conservative defaults, user-defined preservation rules, rollback capabilities

### Challenge: Context Loss
**Solution**: Semantic analysis of entity importance, relationship preservation, audit trails

### Challenge: Performance Impact
**Solution**: Background processing, incremental analysis, caching strategies

## üéØ Success Metrics

1. **Memory Efficiency**: % reduction in storage usage
2. **Query Performance**: Improved graph traversal times
3. **User Satisfaction**: Reduced manual cleanup effort
4. **Safety**: Zero data loss incidents
5. **Intelligence**: Accuracy of stale detection

## ü§î Key Questions for Implementation

1. Which optimization strategies would be most valuable for specific use cases?
2. How aggressive should the default optimization be?
3. What preservation rules are absolutely critical?
4. Should we start with a specific focus area (stale detection, redundancy, etc.)?

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Resolve current PR bugs** - Fix any issues in the deletion tool implementation
2. **Gather requirements** - Define specific optimization scenarios and use cases
3. **Design sampling integration** - Plan how to leverage MCP sampling effectively
4. **Prototype analyzer** - Build basic memory graph analysis capabilities
5. **Implement safety systems** - Create robust rollback and validation mechanisms
