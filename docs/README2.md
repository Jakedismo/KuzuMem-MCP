> **Enhance AI coding assistants with persistent, graph-based knowledge using the official MCP TypeScript SDK**

The KuzuMem-MCP server provides a structured approach to storing and retrieving repository knowledge, enabling AI coding assistants to maintain context across sessions and branches. **Built with the official MCP TypeScript SDK** for guaranteed protocol compliance and seamless integration.

## üéØ Purpose & Goals

This project addresses several key challenges in AI-assisted development:

- **Maintain persistent knowledge** across coding sessions
- **Support branch-based knowledge organization** for development workflows
- **Identify relationships** between components, decisions, and rules
- **Provide graph-based memory storage** for enhanced context retrieval
- **Enable AI tools** to understand project architecture
- **Track file metadata and relationships** with comprehensive file management
- **Universal tagging system** for organizing and discovering any type of entity
- **Client isolation** for supporting multiple client projects with dedicated memory banks
- **Official MCP compliance** using the official TypeScript SDK for reliable integration

## ‚ú® Key Benefits

### üìö Knowledge Persistence

This memory bank enables AI assistants to:

- Track component relationships across your codebase
- Build knowledge incrementally over multiple sessions
- Maintain file metadata including metrics, hashes, and language information
- Organize entities with a flexible tagging system

### üåê Graph-Based Storage

Using **K√πzuDB** as a graph database provides:

- Relationship-aware queries between components
- Context retrieval across connected entities
- Structural representation of system architecture

}
```

### 6. System Structure Discovery

      "cohesion": 0.92
    },
    {

      "name": "Data and Storage",
      "components": ["comp-DataStore", "comp-DataAccess", "comp-CacheLayer"],

  -d '{
    "clientProjectRoot": "/path/to/project",
    "repository": "my-app", 
    "branch": "main", 
    "tagId": "tag-performance",
    "itemTypeFilter": "All"
  }'

# Results show all performance-related entities across different types

    {"id": "file-cache-manager", "nodeLabel": "File", "properties": {"path": "/src/cache/CacheManager.ts", "metrics": {"complexity": 12}}}
  ]
}
```

### 8. Architectural Weakness Detection

```bash
# Find circular dependencies that may indicate design problems
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/tools/strongly-connected-components \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"repository": "my-app", "branch": "main"}'

# Results show components with circular dependencies
{
  "cyclicDependencyGroups": [
    {
      "components": ["comp-UserService", "comp-NotificationService", "comp-UserPreferences"],
      "cycle": "UserService ‚Üí NotificationService ‚Üí UserPreferences ‚Üí UserService",
      "suggestedRefactoring": "Extract notification preferences to a separate component"
    },
    // ... other circular dependency groups
  ]
}
```

These examples demonstrate how the graph-based architecture enables complex queries about component relationships, architectural decisions, and system structure that would be difficult or impossible with traditional databases. AI assistants can use these insights to provide more informed guidance about code changes, architectural evolution, and potential design weaknesses.

### Key Schema Design Elements

1. **Branch-Aware Repository Nodes**

   - Repository nodes use a synthetic primary key (`id = name + ':' + branch`)
   - This enables complete isolation of memory between branches
   - All operations filter by both repository name and branch

2. **Rich Relationship Types**

   - **HAS\_\* relationships** - Connect repositories to memory entities
   - **DEPENDS_ON** - Track component dependencies (self-referential)
   - **CONTEXT_OF\*** - Link context to components, decisions, and rules
   - **DECISION_ON** - Connect decisions to affected components
   - **CONTAINS_FILE** (NEW) - Link components to their implementation files
   - **IS_TAGGED_WITH** (NEW) - Universal tagging relationship for any entity

3. **File and Tag Integration**
   - **File nodes** - Store comprehensive file metadata including metrics, hashes, and language information
   - **Tag nodes** - Global tags with colors and descriptions for cross-cutting organization
   - **Multi-type relationships** - Tags can be applied to any entity type, enabling semantic grouping

4. **Graph Traversal Capabilities**
   - **Multi-hop queries** - Find indirect relationships between components
   - **Ancestor/descendant tracking** - Trace component dependencies or dependents
   - **Path finding** - Discover relationships between seemingly unrelated components
   - **Relationship analysis** - Identify critical components using graph algorithms
   - **Tag-based discovery** - Find related entities through shared tags

This graph structure enables the system to answer complex questions that would be difficult with a traditional database, such as "What components might be affected if I change this service?" or "What context led to this architectural decision?" The addition of file tracking and tagging further enhances the system's ability to understand code organization and cross-cutting concerns.
