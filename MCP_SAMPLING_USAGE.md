# MCP Sampling Support - Usage Guide

## 🎯 **Overview**

MCP Sampling Support enables the Core Memory Optimization Agent to analyze actual memory state and adapt its prompts dynamically for better optimization decisions. This creates context-aware, intelligent optimization strategies tailored to specific project characteristics.

## 🧠 **Key Features**

### **✅ Context-Aware Prompts**
- **Adaptive system prompts** that change based on actual memory graph analysis
- **Project-specific instructions** tailored to maturity, activity, and complexity
- **Real-time memory sampling** to understand current state and patterns

### **✅ Intelligent Project Analysis**
- **Maturity assessment**: new, developing, mature, legacy
- **Activity level detection**: high, medium, low (based on recent entity creation)
- **Complexity scoring**: simple, moderate, complex (based on entity diversity and relationships)
- **Automatic strategy recommendation** based on project characteristics

### **✅ Multiple Sampling Strategies**
- **Representative**: Balanced sample across all entity types
- **Problematic**: Focus on stale, disconnected, or deprecated entities
- **Recent**: Sample newly created entities (< 30 days)
- **Diverse**: Ensure representation from all entity types

## 📋 **Usage Examples**

### **1. Basic Analysis with MCP Sampling (Default)**

```json
{
  "tool": "memory-optimizer",
  "operation": "analyze",
  "repository": "my-project",
  "branch": "main",
  "clientProjectRoot": "/path/to/project",
  "strategy": "conservative",
  "llmProvider": "openai",
  "model": "o1-mini"
}
```

**What happens:**
- ✅ **MCP Sampling enabled by default** (`enableMCPSampling: true`)
- ✅ **Representative sampling** used by default
- ✅ **Context analysis** determines project is "mature with medium activity"
- ✅ **Adaptive prompts** include project-specific instructions
- ✅ **Intelligent optimization** tailored to actual memory state

### **2. Problematic Entity Focus**

```json
{
  "tool": "memory-optimizer",
  "operation": "analyze",
  "repository": "legacy-system",
  "branch": "main",
  "clientProjectRoot": "/path/to/legacy",
  "strategy": "aggressive",
  "enableMCPSampling": true,
  "samplingStrategy": "problematic"
}
```

**What happens:**
- 🎯 **Samples stale and disconnected entities** (> 30 days old, few relationships)
- 🎯 **Identifies legacy patterns** and deprecated components
- 🎯 **Aggressive strategy** recommended for legacy project with low activity
- 🎯 **Focus areas**: stale-detection, orphan-removal

### **3. Recent Entity Analysis**

```json
{
  "tool": "memory-optimizer",
  "operation": "analyze",
  "repository": "active-development",
  "branch": "feature/new-api",
  "clientProjectRoot": "/path/to/active",
  "strategy": "conservative",
  "enableMCPSampling": true,
  "samplingStrategy": "recent"
}
```

**What happens:**
- 🚀 **Samples recent entities** (< 30 days old)
- 🚀 **Detects high activity** project with active development
- 🚀 **Conservative strategy** recommended to avoid disrupting active work
- 🚀 **Focus areas**: obvious-duplicates only

### **4. Comprehensive Diverse Analysis**

```json
{
  "tool": "memory-optimizer",
  "operation": "analyze",
  "repository": "complex-system",
  "branch": "main",
  "clientProjectRoot": "/path/to/complex",
  "strategy": "balanced",
  "enableMCPSampling": true,
  "samplingStrategy": "diverse"
}
```

**What happens:**
- 🔍 **Samples from all entity types** (Components, Decisions, Rules, Files, Contexts, Tags)
- 🔍 **Analyzes complexity** across different entity categories
- 🔍 **Balanced strategy** for moderate complexity project
- 🔍 **Focus areas**: redundancy-removal, relationship-cleanup

### **5. Disable MCP Sampling (Fallback)**

```json
{
  "tool": "memory-optimizer",
  "operation": "analyze",
  "repository": "simple-project",
  "branch": "main",
  "clientProjectRoot": "/path/to/simple",
  "strategy": "conservative",
  "enableMCPSampling": false
}
```

**What happens:**
- ⚡ **Uses standard prompts** without context analysis
- ⚡ **Faster execution** (no sampling overhead)
- ⚡ **Generic optimization** approach
- ⚡ **Useful for simple projects** or when sampling fails

## 🎯 **Project Characteristics Analysis**

### **Maturity Assessment**
- **New**: < 20 entities total
- **Developing**: < 100 entities with > 50% recent activity
- **Mature**: Balanced entity age distribution
- **Legacy**: > 90% old entities (> 90 days), low recent activity

### **Activity Level Detection**
- **High**: > 30% entities created in last 30 days
- **Medium**: 10-30% entities created in last 30 days
- **Low**: < 10% entities created in last 30 days

### **Complexity Scoring (0-100)**
- **Simple** (< 30): Few entity types, low relationship density
- **Moderate** (30-70): Mixed entity types, moderate connections
- **Complex** (> 70): Many entity types, high relationship density

## 🔧 **Adaptive Prompt Examples**

### **Legacy Project Prompt Additions**
```
=== MEMORY CONTEXT ANALYSIS ===
Project Characteristics: legacy project with low activity
Complexity Score: 45/100 (moderate)
Entity Distribution: Component: 45, Decision: 12, Rule: 8, File: 67, Context: 15, Tag: 3
Age Distribution: Recent: 2, Medium: 8, Old: 140
Relationship Density: 1.2 relationships per entity
Recommended Strategy: aggressive
Focus Areas: stale-detection, orphan-removal

=== ADAPTIVE INSTRUCTIONS ===
- Focus heavily on identifying truly obsolete entities from the legacy codebase
- Look for deprecated patterns and outdated architectural decisions
- Adapt your approach for a legacy project with moderate complexity
- Focus on: stale-detection, orphan-removal
```

### **Active Development Project Prompt Additions**
```
=== MEMORY CONTEXT ANALYSIS ===
Project Characteristics: developing project with high activity
Complexity Score: 25/100 (simple)
Entity Distribution: Component: 15, Decision: 8, Rule: 3, File: 22, Context: 12, Tag: 2
Age Distribution: Recent: 35, Medium: 15, Old: 12
Relationship Density: 2.1 relationships per entity
Recommended Strategy: conservative
Focus Areas: obvious-duplicates

=== ADAPTIVE INSTRUCTIONS ===
- Be extra cautious with recent entities as they may be actively used
- Prioritize obvious duplicates over potentially active entities
- Use minimal optimization to avoid disrupting active development
- Focus on obvious cleanup rather than structural changes
- Adapt your approach for a developing project with simple complexity
- Focus on: obvious-duplicates
```

## 📊 **Sampling Strategy Comparison**

| Strategy | Best For | Sample Focus | Use Case |
|----------|----------|--------------|----------|

| **Problematic** | Legacy cleanup | Stale, disconnected entities | Legacy systems, major cleanup |
| **Recent** | Active projects | New entities (< 30 days) | Active development, safety focus |
| **Diverse** | Complex systems | All entity types equally | Complex projects, thorough analysis |

## 🚀 **Performance & Benefits**
