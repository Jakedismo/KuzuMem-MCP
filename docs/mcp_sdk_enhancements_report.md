# MCP SDK Usage, Analysis, and Enhancements Report

**Date:** 2024-07-26

## 1. Initial Analysis Summary (Phase 1)

An initial analysis was conducted to identify potential problems related to the official TypeScript MCP SDK usage and legacy/custom functionalities within the repository.

### Key Findings from Analysis:

*   **SDK Integration:** The MCP SDK is used to expose tools, primarily interfacing with a custom `MemoryService` for graph database operations.
*   **Custom Context:** `EnrichedRequestHandlerExtra` extends the SDK's `RequestHandlerExtra` with a logger, application-specific session data (`clientProjectRoot`, `repository`, `branch`), a `MemoryService` instance, and a custom `sendProgress` helper.
*   **Progress Reporting:** A custom `McpProgressNotification` interface and the `sendProgress` helper adapt internal progress updates to the SDK's `sendNotification` method (apparently using `notifications/progress` method and `ProgressNotification['params']` type).
*   **Error Handling:** A dual error reporting pattern was observed: errors are reported via a progress notification *and* through the standard tool error response path. The recommendation was to make the standard tool response the canonical error source.
*   **Session Management:** A custom, explicit session mechanism is in place, requiring `init-memory-bank` to set `clientProjectRoot`, `repository`, and `branch` for subsequent operations. This is well-enforced.
*   **Legacy/Stubbed Functionality:** Several `MemoryService` methods for file and tagging operations were identified as non-functional stubs.
    *   `addFile`
    *   `associateFileWithComponent`
    *   `addTag`
    *   `tagItem`
    *   `findItemsByTag`
*   **Type Safety:** Minor instances of type casting (`as any`) were noted.

## 2. Implemented Enhancements (Phase 2)

Based on the analysis, the following previously stubbed functionalities in `MemoryService` and their corresponding `ops` modules (`src/services/memory-operations/`) have been implemented:

*   **`addFile`**:
    *   Creates or updates a `File` node in the Kuzu graph database.
    *   Logic resides in `file.ops.ts` (`addFileOp`) using a `MERGE` Cypher query.
    *   `MemoryService.addFile` now invokes this operation.

*   **`associateFileWithComponent`**:
    *   Creates a `CONTAINS_FILE` relationship from a `Component` node to a `File` node.
    *   Logic in `file.ops.ts` (`associateFileWithComponentOp`) uses `MATCH` and `MERGE`.
    *   `MemoryService.associateFileWithComponent` invokes this operation.

*   **`addTag`**:
    *   Creates or updates a global `Tag` node (tags are not repository/branch specific).
    *   Logic in `tag.ops.ts` (`addTagOp`) using a `MERGE` Cypher query.
    *   `MemoryService.addTag` invokes this operation.

*   **`tagItem`**:
    *   Creates an `IS_TAGGED_WITH` relationship from a specified item (`Component`, `File`, `Decision`, `Rule`, `Context`) to a `Tag` node.
    *   Logic in `tag.ops.ts` (`tagItemOp`) dynamically constructs Cypher based on `itemType`.
    *   Assumes tagged items (`Component`, `File`, `Decision`, `Rule`, `Context`) are identifiable by `id`, `repository`, and `branch` for matching purposes.
    *   `MemoryService.tagItem` invokes this operation.

*   **`findItemsByTag`**:
    *   Searches for items linked to a specific `tagId`, scoped by `repository` and `branch`.
    *   Allows filtering by `itemType`.
    *   Logic in `tag.ops.ts` (`findItemsByTagOp`).
    *   `MemoryService.findItemsByTag` invokes this operation.

### General Approach for Implementations:

*   New `ops` modules (`file.ops.ts`, `tag.ops.ts`) were created/updated for database interaction logic, using direct Kuzu client calls.
*   `MemoryService` methods were updated to delegate to these `ops` functions.
*   Error handling within `ops` functions involves logging and rethrowing errors. `MemoryService` methods catch these and either rethrow or return a `{ success: false, message: '...' }` structure (with a recommendation to move towards consistent rethrowing from `MemoryService`).

## 3. Remaining Tasks and Future Work

Based on the initial analysis and subsequent implementations, the following areas remain for future improvement:

*   **Standardize `MemoryService` Error Handling:**
    *   Refine `MemoryService` methods (e.g., `associateFileWithComponent`, `addTag`, `tagItem`) to consistently rethrow errors caught from the `ops` layer, similar to how `addFile` and `findItemsByTag` now operate. This allows tool handlers to be the primary point for translating errors into MCP responses.

*   **Review and Refine Progress Reporting:**
    *   Verify the accuracy of the mapping from `McpProgressNotification` to the SDK's `ProgressNotification['params']` (used with `method: 'notifications/progress'`).
    *   Consider refactoring tool handlers to use the SDK's progress notification parameters directly with `context.sendNotification` if it simplifies the code and improves SDK alignment, potentially removing the `McpProgressNotification` custom interface and `sendProgress` wrapper.

*   **Implement Unit Tests:**
    *   Write comprehensive unit tests for the newly implemented `MemoryService` methods and the logic within `file.ops.ts` and `tag.ops.ts`. This should involve mocking `KuzuDBClient` and `mcpContext`.
    *   The conceptual outline for these tests was completed in Phase 1.

*   **Enhance Type Safety:**
    *   Address any remaining `as any` casts or overly broad types in the codebase, particularly around the new implementations and data flowing to/from `MemoryService`.

*   **Schema Alignment for Tagged Items:**
    *   Verify that `Decision`, `Rule`, and `Context` nodes indeed have `repository` and `branch` properties if they are to be matched using these attributes in `tagItemOp` and `findItemsByTagOp`. Adjust Cypher queries if their scoping is different (e.g., global).

*   **Address Other Original Recommendations:**
    *   Review any other recommendations from the initial "BUG_HUNT_REPORT.md" or the first phase of this AI agent's analysis that have not yet been actioned.
